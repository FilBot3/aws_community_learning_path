# Learning Amazon AWS by Phil

## Overview

With this learning path, I am hoping to help people learn more about AWS by learning in a manner that I feel is logical, and will help in the long run promoting good practices. `AWS` stands for Amazon Web Services, so saying Amazon AWS is kind of redundant.

# Signing up for AWS

This part should be fairly straight forward and easy. Go to the [Amazon AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) landing page, and click `Sign In to the Console` and then follow the prompts for registering to AWS.

You have to meet certain criteria that is detailed in the AWS Limits.
